## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

* [Jupyter Notebook] or [Python 3] - jupyter notebook is an open source and used to data analyze with python code
* [matplotlib] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
* [seaborn] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
* [nltk] - uses to remove stop words for text data
* [numpy] - is a fundamental scientific computing.
* [Pandas] - uses to clean, organize, convert, and merge the data.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Medium data science articles data from 2021 to better understand:

1. What words combinations are the most popular in data science articles?
2. What words combinations get more and less engagement?
3. What is the best words combinations to start and finish headlines?
4. What articles reading time get most engagement?
5. What is the best day of the week to post?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [Here](https://medium.com/@viniciuslambert/how-to-make-more-attractive-articles-for-data-scientists-f96b92c1dd70)

## Data

The data analysed in this notebook was collected by me, using the code present [Here](https://github.com/viniciusLambert/medium-scraping/blob/main/scrap.ipynb).
